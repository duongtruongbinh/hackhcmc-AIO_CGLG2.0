### Introduction <Br>
Our project focuses on enhancing information extraction from an image by integrating Object Detection and Image Captioning. User input image which will be location classified first, then suggest the relevant problems and output bounding boxes of objects and a descriptive image caption. Beside that, we also have a unique feature allows users customize the problems, tailoring the detection and captioning processes to their specific concerns. <Br>
Aim to develop an image analysis tool that can automatically detect the following factors:
- **Brand logos**: Detect logos of Heineken, Tiger, Bia Viet, Larue, Bivina, Edelweiss and Strongbow.
- **Products**: Identify boxes of beer and beer bottles.
- **Consumers**: Evaluate the number, activities and emotions of customers.
- **Advertising items**: Identify brand posters, banners and billboards
- **Visual Context**: Analysis of the locationâ€”restaurant, bar, grocery store or supermarket, etc...
